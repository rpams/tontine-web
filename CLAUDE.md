## Worflow Modification

**CRITICAL RULE**

**BEFORE editing eny files, you MUST Read at least 3 files** that will help you to undertand how to make a coherent and consistency.

This is **NON-NEGOTIABLE**. Do not skip this step under any cirscuntances. Reading existing files ensures:

- Code consistency with project patterns
- Proper undertanding of conventions
- Following established architecture
- Avoiding breaking changes

**Types of files you MUST read**

1. **Similar files***: Read files that do similar functionnality to understand patterns and conventions
2. **Imported dependencies**: Read the d√©finition/implementation of any imports you're not 100% sure to use correctly - understand their API, types, and usage patterns

**Steps to follow**

1. Read at least 3 relevant existing files (similar functionnality + imported dependencies)
2. Understand the patterns, conventions and API usage
3. Only then proceed with creating/editing files
